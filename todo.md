# todo list

a few features i (may) want to implement in my website:

---

considering:   
- [ ] project writeups? (e.g. https://ukarim.kz/rabbitmq-retry.html)   
- [ ] **be able to generate project writeups from md files** -- would make things a lot simpler    
- [ ] interacive projects (js port? python??) on that project tab   
- [ ] dark mode toggle

---

done:
- [x] robots.txt   
- [x] a projects tab with projects that i've done in it
